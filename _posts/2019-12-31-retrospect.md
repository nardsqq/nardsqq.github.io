I'm not a fan of the past, but this year's end will be different. Here's a look on the year that was.

2018.

A lot of things happened and I still can't believe that so much changed within a span of a single year.

The first quarter of this year is both _tears of failure_ and _jumps of joy_. It was a roller coaster ride,
I failed Capstone and I broke down to pieces, it gave me a lingering pain that a person can feel only once 
in his life. It's a pain that one can remember yet I faced it, we faced it. Not too valiant but with the aid 
of others, I was able to pass it finally when the chance was given. It humbled me, it made me realize that
I am weak and that I can ask for help. The gratitude that I'm feeling even up to this day towards the people
that helped me all the way through that challenge is so great that it still makes me smile. I was able to 
graduate on time. It wasn't as joyful as what I expected but it is still great in a way or two. Maybe it's 
because of all the failures that I had to take. It robbed me of the delight of success, or at least only in 
that moment.

I wasn't able to go places or enjoy vacation with my friends because I don't have the chance to. In addition,
when I came back to BotBros for my internship, people from my batch are already leaving. The feeling of not being
able to say goodbye properly to them was painful to me.

Lots of pain, lots of sacrifices, but we did it.
