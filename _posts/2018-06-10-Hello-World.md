To be honest, I don't really know why did I end up setting up a blog all of sudden. As far as I know, I'm just good with reading blog posts not writing them.  
  
I just want a good start, it's my first year as a professional and I want to have a record of my soon to be _colorful_ adventure. I'd like to write about my own experiences
and hopefully you guys might pick something up from my posts. My goal is to inspire and motivate other youngsters like me. I'm not a _genius_ in this field but at least I can still try and learn to be one. 

Have fun reading!
