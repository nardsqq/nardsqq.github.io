Halo-halo, everything else, anything else, kahit ano, timpla, koleksyon ng mga piyesa't ideya.

Musta homie? **You good?** This one will be different from the usual retrospect I do _almost_ every end of the year. It'll just be a _miscellany_ of thoughts, reflections, and events in my head. Most probably, from the right side of my brain heh. _G?_ **G**.

I'm writing this at 3:30 AM while listening to kiyo's HARANASA album on YouTube choosing to suffer from the occasional unskippable ads instead of just pulling up Spotify and spinning up a proper playlist. Also probably chugging a mug of _Coke Zero_ thinking it's an _actual_ alternative to just _Coke_ ever since I was diagnosed of _Prediabetes_. In addition, perhaps snacking on a freshly opened 380g _Stick-O_ too. Fun times, fun times eh? I can't take a hint myself but I think I'm a really bad risk taker. All signs are pointing towards not consuming sugar associated meals yet here I am actively trying to savor my way to death, kek.

Alas, planet Earth completed yet another revolution around the Sun and here we are still trying to figure our way out of this _new normal metaverse pandemic fiasco clown fiesta_ of a life. Don't do a double take, those are mumble jumbles, no deep meanings, just straight _bs_ out of my head. And yep, you possibly guessed it right, I'm not close to _okay_ but surviving at least. I was very careful but existing alone finds a way to kick me down. Lost a bunch of _life_ around me — my dear Lola, my uncle-in-law, my dog, my drive, my _fire_, myself, _my oh my_.
