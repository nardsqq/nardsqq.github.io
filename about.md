This is my personal blog, wherein I muse about my experiences as a software engineer. I try to discuss and describe different tech related topics with my own perspective. I also want to post about the things I learn when possible, every bits and pieces that I can think of.

Hopefully I can write regularly or at least once a month. Happy reading!

### Questions

* _What's with the special characters "&++"?_  
  It's just a sudden thought in my head, it's a _dumb_ "translation" of the word _encounter_.  

* _Will you be updating regularly?_  
  Hopefully, yes.

### Tools

Here's a list of what's in my magical toolbox!

**For writing and editing code/text files:**  
* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)  
_Back then I was a Sublime fan but since a lot of powerful plugins for VSCode came, I made the switch._
