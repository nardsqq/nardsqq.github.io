This is my personal blog, wherein I muse about my experiences as a software engineer. I try to discuss and describe different tech related topics with my own perspective. I also want to post about the things I learn when possible, every bits and pieces that I can think of.

Hopefully I can write regularly or at least once a month. Happy reading!

### Questions

* _What's with the special characters "&++"?_  
  It's just a sudden thought in my head, it's a _dumb_ "translation" of the word _encounter_.

* _Will you be updating regularly?_  
  Hopefully, yes.

### Tools

I prefer to be tool agnostic but here's a list of the ones I usually use.

**Text/Code Editor** —
_Back then I was a Sublime fan but since a lot of powerful plugins for VSCode came, I made the switch. For my VSCode settings, you can check [this](https://gist.github.com/nardsqq/e4b0a0b131952c6ccabe3c8926cacb35)._

_**Update (2022):** Since I'm now specializing on the front-end, I decided to drop Vim for writing code and use it entirely as my terminal editor since VSCode has much better JS/CSS support and hints. Still, you can clone my personal Vim settings [here](https://github.com/nardsqq/.vim)._

* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
* [Vim](https://www.vim.org/)

**Command Line** —

_**Update (2022):** I switched platforms multiple times from **Linux Ubuntu 18.04** in a dual-boot setup into a Linux PC with a fully installed **Manjaro XFCE** environment then when the pandemic hit I had to use my personal computer so I went with a **WSL2 + Ubuntu 20.04** setup, that being said I'm currently working with Windows Terminal + Oh My Zsh configuration on top of Zsh as my command interpreter. I can't find the use for Hyper and Git Bash anymore since I can work in Linux most of the time even in a Windows machine._ 

* [Oh My Zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/)
* [Spaceship Prompt](https://github.com/spaceship-prompt/spaceship-prompt)

**For writing drafts and/or markdown preview** —  

_**Update (2022):** I've dropped Boostnote, tried Notion but moved forward with Obsidian for now._

* [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/)

**A place to keep my configurations and notes** —
_My memory's not that good so I needed a place to dump my notes and configurations, Github's Gist is my current go-to._

* [Gist](https://gist.github.com)

**Web Based Version Control Platform** —

_**Update (2022):** Never left GitHub ever since I moved into it in 2019._

* [Github](https://github.com)

**Messaging** —

_**Update (2022):** I still use Facebook's Messenger from time to time but me and my close friends switched to Discord during the pandemic and it's working like a charm for us right now. Doing a voice call is easy as a snap and we can discuss about different topics and keep them in their respective channels without being confused._

* [Discord](https://discord.com/)
* [Messenger](https://www.messenger.com/)
