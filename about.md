This is my personal blog, wherein I muse about my experiences as a software engineer. I try to discuss and describe different tech related topics with my own perspective. I also want to post about the things I learn when possible, every bits and pieces that I can think of.

Hopefully I can write regularly or at least once a month. Happy reading!

### Questions

* _What's with the special characters "&++"?_  
  It's just a sudden thought in my head, it's a _dumb_ "translation" of the word _encounter_.  

* _Will you be updating regularly?_  
  Hopefully, yes.

### Tools

Here's a list of what's in my magical toolbox!

**For writing and editing code/text files:**  
[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)  
_Back then I was a Sublime fan but since a lot of powerful plugins for VSCode came, I made the switch._

**Command Line Interface:**  
* [Hyper](https://hyper.is/)  
_If you're a developer who owns a Windows machine, Hyper is the go-to CLI that I'd recommend to you. I use it as a container to Git Bash._

**For writing drafts and/or markdown preview:**  
[Boostnote](https://boostnote.io/)  
_This was a quick pickup, I love writing in markdown format and it has a great preview feature._
