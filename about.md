This is my personal blog, wherein I muse about my experiences as a software engineer. I try to discuss and describe different tech related topics with my own perspective. I also want to post about the things I learn when possible, every bits and pieces that I can think of.

Hopefully I can write regularly or at least once a month. Happy reading!

### Questions

* _What's with the special characters "&++"?_
  It's just a sudden thought in my head, it's a _dumb_ "translation" of the word _encounter_.

* _Will you be updating regularly?_
  Hopefully, yes.

### Tools

I prefer to be tool agnostic but here's a list of the ones I usually use.

**Text/Code Editor** —
_Back then I was a Sublime fan but since a lot of powerful plugins for VSCode came, I made the switch. For my VSCode settings, you can check [this](https://gist.github.com/nardsqq/e4b0a0b131952c6ccabe3c8926cacb35)._

_**Update (2021):** I'm still currently in the process of learning Vim as an alternative to VSCode for software development. You can clone my personal Vim settings [here](https://github.com/nardsqq/.vim)._

* [Vim](https://www.vim.org/)

**Command Line** —
~~If you're a developer who owns a Windows machine, Hyper is the go-to CLI that I'd recommend to you. I [use](https://gist.github.com/nardsqq/5722649b31b11b9a0c2e9836f949e1df) it as a container to Git Bash.~~

_**Update (2021):** _I switched platforms multiple times from **Linux Ubuntu 18.04** in a dual-boot setup into a Linux PC with a fully installed **Manjaro XFCE** environment then when the pandemic hit I had to use my personal computer so I went with a **WSL2 + Ubuntu 20.04** setup, that being said I'm currently working with Windows Terminal + Oh My Zsh configuration on top of Zsh as my command interpreter. I can't find the use for Hyper and Git Bash anymore since I can work in Linux most of the time even in a Windows machine._

**For writing drafts and/or markdown preview** —
_This was a quick pickup, I love writing in markdown format and it has a great preview feature._

* [Boostnote](https://boostnote.io/)

**A place to keep my configurations and notes** —
_My memory's not that good so I needed a place to dump my notes and configurations, Github's Gist is my current go-to._

* [Gist](https://gist.github.com)

**Web Based Version Control Platform** —
~~For side projects, Github is king. At work, we use Gitlab because of its free unlimited private repositories.~~

_**Update:** After transferring to a new role and company, I now use Github most of the time. Especially after the free private repository update._

* [Github](https://github.com)

**Password Manager** —
_I don't really like the use of password managers (I'm a privacy freak) but here's the one I'm using when I need to._

* [LastPass](https://www.lastpass.com/)

**Messaging** —
~~Currently, I'm used to Facebook's Messenger app but I'd like to make a switch to Telegram. In addition, for work and tech community chatting, there's Slack.~~

_**Update (2021):**_ I still use Facebook's Messengerr from time to time but me and my close friends switch to Discord during the pandemic and it's working like a charm for us right now. Doing a voice call is easy as a snap and we can discuss about different topics and keep them in their respective channels without being confused.

* [Telegram](https://telegram.org/)
