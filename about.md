This is my personal blog, wherein I muse about my experiences as a software engineer. I try to discuss and describe different tech related topics with my own perspective. I also want to post about the things I learn when possible, every bits and pieces that I can think of.

Hopefully I can write regularly or at least once a month. Happy reading!

### Questions

* _What's with the special characters "&++"?_  
  It's just a sudden thought in my head, it's a _dumb_ "translation" of the word _encounter_.  

* _Will you be updating regularly?_  
  Hopefully, yes.

### Tools

I prefer to be tool agnostic but here's a list of the ones I usually use.

**Text/Code Editor** —
_Back then I was a Sublime fan but since a lot of powerful plugins for VSCode came, I made the switch. For my editor's configuration, you can check [this](https://gist.github.com/nardsqq/e4b0a0b131952c6ccabe3c8926cacb35)._

* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)  

**Command Line Interface** —
_If you're a developer who owns a Windows machine, Hyper is the go-to CLI that I'd recommend to you. I [use](https://gist.github.com/nardsqq/5722649b31b11b9a0c2e9836f949e1df) it as a container to Git Bash._

* [Hyper](https://hyper.is/)  

**For writing drafts and/or markdown preview** —
_This was a quick pickup, I love writing in markdown format and it has a great preview feature._

* [Boostnote](https://boostnote.io/)  

**A place to keep my configurations and notes** —
_My memory's not that good so I needed a place to dump my notes and configurations, Github's Gist is my current go-to._

* [Gist](https://gist.github.com)  

**To keep track of my activities** —
_It's a recent pickup but I decided to use a task manager app and ended up choosing Todoist._

**Web Based Version Control Platform** —
_For side projects, Github is king. At work, we use Gitlab because of its free unlimited private repositories._

* [Github](https://github.com)  
* [Gitlab](https://about.gitlab.com/)  

**Password Manager** —
_I don't really like the use of password managers (I'm a privacy freak) but here's the one I'm using._

* [LastPass](https://www.lastpass.com/)  

**Messaging** —
_Currently, I'm used to Facebook's Messenger app but I'd like to make a switch to Telegram. In addition, for work and tech community chatting, there's Slack._

* [Messenger](https://www.messenger.com/)  
* [Slack](www.slack.com/‎)
* [Telegram](https://telegram.org/)
