This is my personal blog, wherein I muse about my experiences as a software engineer. I try to discuss and describe different tech related topics with my own perspective. I also want to post about the things I learn when possible, every bits and pieces that I can think of.

Hopefully I can write regularly or at least once a month. Happy reading!

### Questions

* _What's with the special characters "&++"?_  
  It's just a sudden thought in my head, it's a _dumb_ "translation" of the word _encounter_.  

* _Will you be updating regularly?_  
  Hopefully, yes.
